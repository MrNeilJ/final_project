In here I will just be breaking down the application bit by bit to get a better understanding of what needs
to be done.

Application Goal:
Create a text based application that will have the user go through a "maze".  In the maze there will
be some sort of goal (find a key, find an item, think of clue) in order to win.

Application Theme:
The game will consist of a simple bank robbery game.  The goal is to sneak in, disable the alarm, find the key, and
get out before the cops arrive.  The team will have a total of 10 lock picks (60% chance of successful picking).
If a lock pick breaks, it raises the chance of the cops coming by 10%.  If the alarm is triggered, the cops will
arrive within 20 turns.

Better breakdown:
	Robber (main player)
		- Items
			- Lock pick
				- Amount (10)
				- Chance of success is 70%
			- Vault Key
				- Amount (0)
					- Must find the key in order to increase amount
		- Pointers
			- Current room
				- Will point to the room that the robber is currently standing in
		- Methods
			- Move(direction)
				- Will move the robber to the requested room.
	Cops (triggered event)
		- Called
			- Starts at 0%
			- Each failed Lock pick raises % called by 10%
			- Rolls each time a lock pick is used.
		- Turns
			- Starts at 20
			- Each move the player does will decrease this timer by 1.
			- Once it hits 0, the player has lost.

		- Vault room:
			- Directions (derived from Empty room)

					- Robber value increase by 200 thousand
				- grab the shining idol in the back corner
					- Raises chance of cops coming by 100%
					- Robber value increases by 10 million
			- Room Description:
				- If you don't have the key:
					- "You reach the shiny gray door labeled Vault, but notice that it requires a key
					   a key to get in, better come back once we have found the key"
				- If you have the vault key:
					- "You see the shiny gray door labeled Vault, you stick the key in and open it slowly.
						as you open it you see mounds of money everywhere, and a suspicious little idol in
						the corner on what looks like cobblestone."
		- Front Door:
			- Directions (derived from Empty room)
			- Door Status:
				- Locked
					- Lock Picking chance:
						- 90%
			- Events:
				- Pick door (if locked)
				- Leave
			- Room Description:
				- "You are standing at the Entrance to the bank, time to decide, do we leave? or do we keep going?"

Room connections:
Each room will utilize the North South East West features, which will link to another room.
This will be linking it via pointers to different rooms. This will allow it to work similar to a doubly linked
list. The user will be able to go back and forth, changing their current location.

We will utilize a location pointer stored inside of the robber class to implement keeping track of their location.

We will have a move method that will take in a command, "north" "south" "east" west" and will check to see if there is
an actual pointer at that spot, if it returns null, then tell them that that direction points towards a wall.
Otherwise allow them to move the current location to that pointed object. This is what will create the illusion
of movement throughout the game.

 Room








How the game play should look:
Create the theme:
"It was a dark stormy night, the heavy sound of rain masks your steps as you approach.  You look up and see
the dimly light sign showing "Bank of the North". You jiggle door handle and see that it is locked.

What would you like to do?
    1) Attempt to pick the lock
    2) Continue walking down the street and never look back

If the user selects 2, the game will end.

Otherwise if the user selects 1, allow them to attempt to unlock the door.

Run through the robbers pick procedure, if they are successful then allow the user to move into the main room.

How the movement should work:
When the user selects a room, it'll then attempt to move them in that direction, if they are able to. Each room
will host a different slew of options as to what they can search for in that room.

Example of what a room prompt will look like:

"You walk into the room, but see nothing of interest."

What would you like to do?
    1) Search Room
    2) Move to the next room

If the user selects 1:
Run the search function to see if / what the user finds
Once search is done, loop back to the initial options.

If the user selects 2:
Which direction would you like to go?
    1) North
    2) South
    3) East
    4) West

If the direction the user chooses is NULL
You run your hand across the wall, but you see no way to proceed that direction.

Loop back to the search option.

Which direction would you like to go?
    1) North
    2) South
    3) East
    4) West

If the option is a valid room, proceed to the next room.
