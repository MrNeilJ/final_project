In here I will just be breaking down the application bit by bit to get a better understanding of what needs
to be done.

Application Goal:
Create a text based application that will have the user go through a "maze".  In the maze there will
be some sort of goal (find a key, find an item, think of clue) in order to win.

Application Theme:
The game will consist of a simple bank robbery game.  The goal is to sneak in, disable the alarm, find the key, and
get out before the cops arrive.  The team will have a total of 10 lock picks (60% chance of successful picking).
If a lock pick breaks, it raises the chance of the cops coming by 10%.  If the alarm is triggered, the cops will
arrive within 20 turns.

Better breakdown:
	Robber (main player)
		- Items
			- Lock pick
				- Amount (10)
				- Chance of success is 70%
			- Vault Key
				- Amount (0)
					- Must find the key in order to increase amount
	Cops (triggered event)
		- Called
			- Starts at 0%
			- Each failed Lock pick raises % called by 10%
			- Rolls each time a lock pick is used.
		- Turns
			- Starts at 20
			- Each move the player does will decrease this timer by 1.
			- Once it hits 0, the player has lost.
